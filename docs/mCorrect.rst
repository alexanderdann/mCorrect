**mCorrect: multiset correlation estimation, computation, and testing**


A python implementation of the Techniques for model selection and correlation structure estimation in multiple datasets.
The toolbox consists of multiple techniques to perform the above using both linear and non-linear techniques.

* The Linear technique to estimate correlation structure in a multi-dataset is based on the techniques demonstrated in [1]_ .

* Non-linear techniques : Todo  

Given a multi-modal dataset, this technique estimates the following:

The number of correlated components across the datasets.
The structure of the correlated components
The technique solves the complete model selection problem using statistical methods comprising of linear and non-linear estimation algorithms
